            <h1>Item of the Week: Syllabus</h1>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The item I have chosen is a syllabus I received on Thursday, 1/22.</p>
            <p>The item is quite literally two pieces of paper with printed text on it and stapled together.</p>
            <p>The paper is basic printer paper, very thin and very foldable or bendable.</p>
            <p>The staple is metallic, very hard, but also thin—though not as thin as the paper.</p>
            <p>The text contains information about a course I am taking this semester with pretty much everything that I need to know.</p>

            <h2>Anecdote</h2>
            <p>I received this syllabus during the first week of the semester while sitting in Scott Hall. It was one of those classes where you do not know what to expect.</p>
            <p>I eventually came across it again while unpacking my bag at home and thought to myself, “Do I have any use for this anymore?” I then opted to throw it into the recycling bin.</p>
